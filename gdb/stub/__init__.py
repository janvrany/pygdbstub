            Interrupt remote target as if a control-C was pressed on the remote terminal. This is the equivalent
            to reacting to the ^C (`\003`, the control-C character) character in all-stop mode while the target
            is running, except this works in non-stop mode. See interrupting remote targets, for more info on the
            all-stop variant.
